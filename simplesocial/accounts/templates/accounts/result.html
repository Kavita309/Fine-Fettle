         The most common treatments for fever include over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Children and teens should not take aspirin.

          Decongestants come in oral or nasal spray forms.

          If you have a runny nose, postnasal drip, or itchy, watery eyes -- then an antihistamine may be helpful for your flu symptoms. </h2>

Death occurred from overwhelming infection, pneumonia, intestinal bleeding, or intestinal perforation. With antibiotics and supportive care, mortality has been reduced to 1%-2%. With appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is usually improvement within one to two days and recovery within seven to 10 days.</h2>

        There are several types of drugs used to treat high blood pressure, including:

      <li>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)</li>
      <li>Diuretics</li>

      <li>Alpha-agonists</li>
      <li>Renin inhibitors</li>
      <li>Combination medications</li>
      <li>Diuretics are often recommended as the first line of therapy for most people who have high blood pressure.
        However, your doctor may start a medicine other than a diuretic as the first line of therapy if you have certain medical problems. For example, ACE inhibitors are often a choice for a people with diabetes. If one drug doesn't work or is disagreeable, additional medications or alternative medications may be recommended.
